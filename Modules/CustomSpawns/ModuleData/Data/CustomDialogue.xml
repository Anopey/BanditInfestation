RECOGNIZED LOGIC

OR: OR | ||
NOT: !

RECOGNIZED CONSEQUENCES. War, Peace, BarterPeace are not yet tested and probably will not work as expected since the Diplomacy System of Custom Spawns is pretty bad right now.

Leave
Battle
War
Peace
Surrender(isPlayer) Enter true or false as parameter. case insensitive.

BARTER CONSEQUENCES are like regular consequences but they have to be attached to a line that the player will never see. This is how the TW system works currently, or at least I couldn't find an easy way to circumvent it. Check examples in Calradia at War for barters.

BarterPeace
BarterNoAttack
