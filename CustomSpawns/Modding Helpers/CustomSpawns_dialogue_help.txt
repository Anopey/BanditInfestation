< Useful Info >

	Magic tokens
		Magic tokens are my name for tokens which do specific things. So far there are only two known ones: "start" 
		and "close_window." Start is an introduction dialogue, so is always true and checked at the start of each 
		conversation. Close_window closes the dialogue window for a conversation end or battle.
		
	Useful tokens to know
		Some useful base-game tokens that you can link your dialogues to.
			- lord_start: Defines the dialogue line a lord says just before giving the player his options like fight, 
			ask for barter, etc. Can be chained with custom intros (i.e custom lord intro > lord_start) so the dialogue 
			flows normally.
